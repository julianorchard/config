#+title: My Configuration Files
#+description: I manage all my configuration files literately through Emacs Org Mode. This is the index page for all my different configs for Emacs, Vim, Windows 10, and Arch Linux (btw).

*These are my old, literate config files. See the [[https://github.com/julianorchard/dotfiles][main branch]] for the most up-to-date version.*

** What is this?

This is a series of [[https://orgmode.org/][Org documents]] which contain all the code for *all my configurations*. To make use of it, open each file in Emacs. Then tangle all the code to the right places with:

#+begin_src elisp
M-x org-babel-tangle
#+end_src

I will eventually make this easier...

** What's actually here?

This repo contains literate configurations for:

- [[file:emacs.org][Emacs]]
- [[file:windows.org][Windows 10]]
- [[file:vim.org][Vim]]
- [[file:arch.org][Arch Linux (btw)]]
- +Remote Server+

There's a lot of credits to random snippets of code here, within the Org documents. But some of the big inspirations of large portions go to:

- [[https://github.com/daviwil/dotfiles][Daviwil's literate dotfiles]], and [[https://github.com/daviwil/emacs-from-scratch][his Emacs From Scratch series]]
- [[https://tecosaur.github.io/emacs-config/config.html][Tecosaur's config]], AKA /the most beautiful literate configuration I've ever seen/

For my Emacs configuration, specifically:

- [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom Emacs]], of course
- [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d][RedGuardToo's]] dotfiles, and also his [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/mastering-emacs-in-one-year-guide][Mastering Emacs in One Year]] Guide
- [[https://github.com/MatthewZMD/.emacs.d][MatthewZMD's M-Emacs]]

For my Vim configuration, specifically:

- [[https://github.com/tpope][Tim Pope]], for obvious reasons
- The dotfiles of [[https://github.com/blueyed][Daniel Hahler]]
