We do not think ourselves into new ways of living, we live ourselves into new ways of thinking.

** What is this? 

This is a series of [[https://orgmode.org/][Org documents]] which contain all the code for *all my configurations*. To make use of it, open each file in Emacs. Then tangle all the code to the right places with:

#+begin_src elisp
M-x org-babel-tangle
#+end_src

I will eventually make this easier.

** What's actually here?

Here are the documents that have (and haven't) been converted to this literate configuration yet:

- [[file:emacs.org][Emacs]]
- [[file:windows.org][Windows 10]]
- [[file:vim.org][Vim]]
- [[file:arch.org][Arch Linux (btw)]] /(literate transfer in progress)/
- Remote Server /(literate transfer yet to begin)/

** See Also

There's a lot of credits to random snippets of code here, within the Org documents. But some of the big inspirations of large portions go to:

- [[https://github.com/daviwil/dotfiles][Daviwil's literate dotfiles]], and [[https://github.com/daviwil/emacs-from-scratch][his Emacs From Scratch series]] 
- [[https://tecosaur.github.io/emacs-config/config.html][Tecosaur's config]], AKA /the most beautiful literate configuration I've ever seen/

For my Emacs configuration, specifically: 

- [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom]], of course; it's so useful even for a non-doomemacs config like this
- [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d][RedGuardToo's]] dotfiles, and also his [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/mastering-emacs-in-one-year-guide][Mastering Emacs in One Year]] Guide 
- [[https://github.com/MatthewZMD/.emacs.d][MatthewZMD's M-Emacs]]
