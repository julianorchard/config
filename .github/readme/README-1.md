## About

- For colour schemes I'm switching between [pinkmare](https://github.com/Matsuuu/pinkmare), [Rose Pine](https://github.com/rose-pine/neovim), or [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/emacs) at the moment
- I'm using [Comic Shanns](https://github.com/shannpersand/comic-shanns) (patched) and recently switched from [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) everything
- I'm on Ubuntu most of the time
- I'm primarily using Neovim, very rarely Emacs

## Deploy

I use a [bare git repo](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) to
manage these files, as I think it's simply and *fairly* system agnostic:

```sh
curl -Lks https://julianorchard.co.uk/bin/install.sh | /bin/bash
```
