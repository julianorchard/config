They're mainly used on Windows, Ubuntu, and occasionally with Arch on my ThinkPad x220. They contain scripts for said systems, as well as [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) configurations.

## Background

I started my journey storing these files with a bare git repo (following steps [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles)). I then moved to a [literate configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) (which you can still see, [here](https://github.com/julianorchard/dotfiles/tree/literate)), which used Emacs [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org/). Finally, I've moved back to using a bare repo.

Basically, using a literate configuration made it feel like I was working on a large text document rather than directly with a computer. I like Org mode for task management, but writing code in a literate way wasn't as fun (and the same kind of detailed documentation can be achieved with long code comments).

## Deploy

I use a [bare git repo](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) to manage these files, as I think it's one of the most system-agnostic methods. It does mean you need Cygwin or Git Bash on Windows (I mainly use the latter).

You can execute a command like this to install the dotfiles from a remote source:

```sh
curl -Lks https://julianorchard.co.uk/bin/install.sh | /bin/bash
```

## Featured Scripts

The below is generated by `.bin/readme-details.py`!
### font-install-arch <sup>[file](.bin/font-install-arch)</sup>

Shell script to quickly install fonts, from online, on my ThinkPad x220. But obviously *may* work on many nix systems.

### git-commit-date-fix.sh <sup>[file](.bin/git-commit-date-fix.sh)</sup>

Use this script to fix commit dates on recent git commits. You can specify looking at more historic commits by inputting an integer as an argument, for example, this will show 20 of the most recent commits for you to select from (default is 5): ```sh $ ./git-commit-date-fix.sh 20 ``` The other thing you can do is include a string argument. This will be used to change the git command used (for example, my `config` custom bash function).

### shortcuts.bat <sup>[file](.bin/shortcuts.bat)</sup>

Use this script to create a shortcut to the current folder you're in. I've found this especially useful for CMD navigation.

### Wallpaper-Set.ps1 <sup>[file](.bin/Wallpaper-Set.ps1)</sup>

This wallpaper setter uses ImageMagick to add text with the current time before setting it as the wallpaper.

I don't really use this anymore, but it worked really nicely at one point.

### callsign.py <sup>[file](.bin/callsign.py)</sup>

Slight refactor attempt of [this repo](https://www.zappshelter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Headshots-Stav.jpg) but to include things like ability to write in uppercase/lowercase. It was a fun script to write, if only for experience refactoring.

### cmdrc.bat <sup>[file](.bin/cmdrc.bat)</sup>

This is a method of having a custom prompt in CMD. It's opened by AutoHotkey (see ahk/general.ahk for more information).

### refreshprompt.bat <sup>[file](.bin/refreshprompt.bat)</sup>

The main use case for this being whenever we change Git profiles. This isn't something I do as often as I used to.

### pm-cal.py <sup>[file](.bin/pm-cal.py)</sup>

Simply returns your next ical event from Proton Calendar.

### Install-Fonts.ps1 <sup>[file](.bin/Install-Fonts.ps1)</sup>

Install some of my favourite (and most relevant to this set of dotfiles) fonts: - [Anonymice NF](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/) - [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/) - [Fira Code Mono Italic](https://github.com/zwaldowski/Fira/raw/zwaldowski/mod-new/otf/)

### psrc.ps1 <sup>[file](.bin/psrc.ps1)</sup>

A small powershell configuration file with a few custom functions.

### seo-kw-audit <sup>[file](.bin/seo-kw-audit)</sup>

This is a simple tool used to generate a little CSV report on keywords. The only places it looks (at the moment) are in `<title>` and `<h1>` tags. It is also mainly configured to look at `.php` files, as this is what was required for my work.

### layout <sup>[file](.bin/layout)</sup>

Set default screen layouts using xrandr and resetting the wallpaper, basically.

### ll.bat <sup>[file](.bin/ll.bat)</sup>

`dir` isn't it my muscle memory at all.

### readme-details.py <sup>[file](.bin/readme-details.py)</sup>

This is the script that generates what you might be reading *now*! It scrapes the `.bin/` folder and gets the text under the *'description'* heading (above). It's pretty simple, but nice to give an overview of what files are in this repo.

### commit.ps1 <sup>[file](.bin/commit.ps1)</sup>

Should only be used until learnt properly (I don't really use it anymore). Used for creating semantic commits. Text taken from this Gist: https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716

### install.sh <sup>[file](.bin/install.sh)</sup>

Install the dotfiles. Edited from the [original source](https://bitbucket.org/durdn/cfg/src/master/.bin/install.sh).

### config.bat <sup>[file](.bin/config.bat)</sup>

The command used to manage the bare repo: ```cmd git --git-dir=%HOME%/.dotfiles/ --work-tree=%HOME% ``` ... for use in the Windows CMD.

### drives.bat <sup>[file](.bin/drives.bat)</sup>

Add shortcuts to available drives.

These are my personal dotfiles. If you want to fork this repo and use them, that's absolutely fine, but (unless you find a breaking change) I probably won't be accepting PRs.
