They're mainly used on Windows, Ubuntu, and occasionally with Arch. They mainly contain scripts for said systems, as well as Emacs, Vim, and VS Code configurations.

## History

I started my journey storing these files with a bare git repo (following steps [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles)). I then moved to a [literate configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming), using Emacs [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org/). Finally, I've moved *back to using a bare repo*.

Why did I change this? Using a literate configuration made everything reproducible, easy to manage, and thoroughly documented!

The main reason is because I realised I was getting *slightly* too stuck into Emacs, and I still enjoy using Vim and have even started using VS Code (with the Vim plugin installed, of course). It also didn't work well on remote servers, as I'm not a fan of terminal Emacs.

Using a literate configuration made it feel like I was working on a large text document rather than directly with a computer. I found I stopped writing as much code and started using Org to manage tasks and things more. This was good, but I want to do programming and scripting. I stopped writing scripts (in anything by Elisp) which improved my workflow.

So I'm back to doing it like this, and I'm happy with that to be honest.

## Deploy

I use a [bare git repo](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) to manage these files, as I think it's one of the most system-agnostic methods. It does mean you need Cygwin or Git Bash on Windows (I mainly use the latter).

You can execute a command like this to install the dotfiles from a remote source:

```sh
<<<<<<< HEAD
$ curl -Lks https://julianorchard.co.uk/bin/install.sh
=======
$ curl -Lks https://julianorchard.co.uk/bin/install.sh | /bin/bash
>>>>>>> 4dcd7dec95ed65432cc4da23630df75420024ee7
```

## Featured Scripts

The below is generated by `.bin/readme-details.py`!

#### `amiconnected.bat`:

Simply uses ping to check if we have an internet connection. Very simple script and not very intelligently implemented, but works as a quick tool to tell you notify you when you're back online.

#### `callsign.py`:

Slight refactor attempt of https://github.com/tahtacipolat/callsign, to include things like ability to write in uppercase/lowercase. Everything

is written in Turkish so I don't understand what's going on, but it was an interesting script to write, if only for experience refactoring.

#### `commit.ps1`:

This should just be a tool until used to doing it properly! Used for creating semantic commits. Text taken from this Gist: https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716

#### `config.bat`:

The command used to manage the bare repo: ```cmd git --git-dir=%HOME%/.dotfiles/ --work-tree=%HOME% ``` ... for use in the Windows CMD.

#### `git-commit-date-fix.sh`:

Use this script to fix commit dates on recent git commits. You can specify looking at more historic commits by inputting an integer as an argument, for example, this will show 20 of the most recent commits for you to select from (default is 10): $ ./git-commit-date-fix.sh 20

#### `Install-Fonts.ps1`:

Install some of my favourite (and most relevant to this set of dotfiles) fonts.

#### `install.sh`:

Original source: https://bitbucket.org/durdn/cfg/src/master/.bin/install.sh ======= #!/bin/bash

install .sh

---

Slightly edited from the original which is (c) Nicola Paolucci. #### `install.sh`:

Written by Nicola Paolucci, edited by me to install/manage my dotfiles respository. Original source: https://bitbucket.org/durdn/cfg/src/master/.bin/install.sh

#### `ll.bat`:

Also, DIR isn't it my muscle memory at all.

#### `mamp-fix.sh`:

MAMP, for me, seems to have an issue. This is the quickfix.

#### `mklist.bat`:

I use this surprisingly frequently.

Probably not best practice because using DIR ouput (which

I *assume* would run into similar issues to doing the same with bash, which I know is definitely not good practice).

#### `msgBox.vbs`:

This is mainly called by a few CMD scripts.

#### `nitter-rss-generator.py`:

Gets a list of your Twitter followers and makes a nice little Nitter formatted URL RSS feed. Uses tweepy.

#### `numberddomainseach.bat`:

Used to find out how many instances of a domain with numbers in (e.g. test1.com, test2.com, ...) are live/pingable.

#### `ps.bat`:

I need to open PowerShell with `-ExecutionPolicy bypass` when I'm at work, because *REASONS*. This also adds the `-NoLogo` flag when opening. It also makes sure the PowerShell profile is loaded.

#### `readme-details.py`:

This is the script that generates what you might be reading *now*! It scrapes the `.bin/` folder and gets the text under the 'description' heading (above). It's pretty simple, but nice to give an overview of what files are in this repo.

#### `refreshprompt.bat`:

The main use case for this being whenever we change Git profiles. This isn't something I do as often as I used to.

#### `rm.bat`:

Because del is not in my muscle memory.

#### `seo-kw-audit`:

This is a simple tool used to generate a little CSV report on keywords. The only places it looks (at the moment) are in `<title>` and `<h1>` tags. It is also mainly configured to look at .php files, as this is what was required for my work.

#### `shortcuts.bat`:

Use this script to create a shortcut to the current folder you're in.

I've found this especially useful for CMD navigation!

#### `spooler.ps1`:

This was created for a colleague to help them print things more easily. It works in tandem with spooler.ahk (which can be found, seperately, in the ./ahk/ directory). It requires an external AutoHotkey script to run (you can read more about this in the AutoHotkey part of the file). This part of the project handles some of the printing part. It prints PDF's, so we needed to route it through the default PDF reader.

#### `Wallpaper-Set.ps1`:

This wallpaper setter uses ImageMagick to add text with the current time before setting it as the wallpaper.

I don't really use this anymore, but it worked really nicely at one point.

## Contributing

These are my personal dotfiles. If you want to fork this repo and use them, that's absolutely fine, but (unless you find a breaking change) I probably won't be accepting PRs.

## License

Everything here, unless otherwise stated[^1], is under the MIT License. See [License](/LICENSE) for more information.

[^1]: Emacs typically uses GPLv3+, but this is compatible with the MIT license. Chocolatey is under the Apache 2.0 license, so again, compatible.
