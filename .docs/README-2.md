## Contributing

These are my personal dotfiles. If you want to fork this repo and use them,
that's absolutely fine, but (unless you find a breaking change) I probably
won't be accepting PRs.

## Credits

These credits don't cover every resource that has helped me on my way to these
configurations, but they're hopefully giving credit to some of the biggest
influences on them...

#### Vim/Neovim

- My Neovim config ~~is~~ was initially based on
  [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) (I made the
  switch when the [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) package
  manager became unmaintained)
- [Tim Pope](https://github.com/tpope), for obvious reasons
- [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen) for getting me out of Emacs
  and into Neovim
- Random bits from the dotfiles of [Daniel Hahler](https://github.com/blueyed)

#### Emacs

- A more minimal Emacs configuration by [Ronmi](https://github.com/Ronmi/emacs)
  is the biggest inspiration for my most recent Emacs version
- [Daviwil's Emacs From Scratch
  series](https://github.com/daviwil/emacs-from-scratch) (which is what got me
  into Emacs in the first place!)
- [Tecosaur's config](https://tecosaur.github.io/emacs-config/config.html), a
  beautiful literate configuration
- [RedGuardToo's](https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d) dotfiles, plus his
  [Mastering Emacs in One
  Year](https://github.com/redguardtoo/mastering-emacs-in-one-year-guide) Guide
- [Protesilaos' config](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/dotemacs) and his
  [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@protesilaos)

#### Windows

- [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) for their very useful
  [`refresh.cmd`](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/blob/develop/src/chocolatey.resources/redirects/RefreshEnv.cmd)
