## Credits

These credits don't cover every resource that has helped me on my way to these configurations, but they're hopefully giving credit to some of the biggest influences on them...

#### Emacs

- [Daviwil's literate dotfiles](https://github.com/daviwil/dotfiles) and [his Emacs From Scratch series](https://github.com/daviwil/emacs-from-scratch) (which is what got me into Emacs in the first place!)
- [Tecosaur's config](https://tecosaur.github.io/emacs-config/config.html); *the most beautiful literate configuration I've ever seen*
- Even though I don't use it direcitly, [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) has been a massive help
- [RedGuardToo's](https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d) dotfiles, plus his [Mastering Emacs in One Year](https://github.com/redguardtoo/mastering-emacs-in-one-year-guide) Guide
- [MatthewZMD's M-Emacs](https://github.com/MatthewZMD/.emacs.d)
- [Protesilaos'](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/dotemacs) great Emacs tips, packages (especially themes), and [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@protesilaos)

#### Vim

- [Tim Pope](https://github.com/tpope), for obvious reasons
- The dotfiles of [Daniel Hahler](https://github.com/blueyed)
