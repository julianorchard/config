# Dotfiles & Configurations

They're mainly used on Windows, Ubuntu, and occasionally with Arch on my ThinkPad x220. They contain scripts for said systems, as well as [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) configurations.

## Background

I started my journey storing these files with a bare git repo (following steps [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles)). I then moved to a [literate configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) (which you can still see, [here](https://github.com/julianorchard/dotfiles/tree/literate)), which used Emacs [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org/). Finally, I've moved back to using a bare repo.

Basically, using a literate configuration made it feel like I was working on a large text document rather than directly with a computer. I like Org mode for task management, but writing code in a literate way wasn't as fun (and the same kind of detailed documentation can be achieved with long code comments).

## Deploy

I use a [bare git repo](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) to manage these files, as I think it's one of the most system-agnostic methods. It does mean you need Cygwin or Git Bash on Windows (I mainly use the latter).

You can execute a command like this to install the dotfiles from a remote source:

```sh
curl -Lks https://julianorchard.co.uk/bin/install.sh | /bin/bash
```
