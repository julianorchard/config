# Dotfiles and Configurations

They're mainly used on Windows, Ubuntu, and occasionally with Arch. They mainly contain scripts for said systems, as well as Emacs, Vim, and VS Code configurations.

## History

I started my journey storing these files with a bare git repo (following steps [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles)). I then moved to a [literate configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming), using Emacs [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org/). Finally, I've moved *back to using a bare repo*.

Why did I change this? Using a literate configuration made everything reproducible, easy to manage, and thoroughly documented!

The main reason is because I realised I was getting *slightly* too stuck into Emacs, and I still enjoy using Vim and have even started using VS Code (with the Vim plugin installed, of course). It also didn't work well on remote servers, as I'm not a fan of terminal Emacs.

Using a literate configuration made it feel like I was working on a large text document rather than directly with a computer. I found I stopped writing as much code and started using Org to manage tasks and things more. This was good, but I want to do programming and scripting. I stopped writing scripts (in anything by Elisp) which improved my workflow.

So I'm back to doing it like this, and I'm happy with that to be honest.

## Deploy

I use a [bare git repo](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) to manage these files, as I think it's one of the most system-agnostic methods. It does mean you need Cygwin or Git Bash on Windows (I mainly use the latter).

You can execute a command like this to install the dotfiles from a remote source:

```sh
$ curl -Lks https://julianorchard.co.uk/bin/install.sh | /bin/bash
```
