# Dotfiles & Configurations

> These are my `dotfiles`. There are many like them, but these ones are mine.
>
> My `dotfiles` are my best friends. They are my life. I must master them as I master my life.
>
> My `dotfiles`, without me, are useless. Without my `dotfiles`, I am useless.

## Deploy

I use a [bare git repo](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) to manage these files, as I think it's simply and *fairly* system agnostic:

```sh
curl -Lks https://julianorchard.co.uk/bin/install.sh | /bin/bash
```
